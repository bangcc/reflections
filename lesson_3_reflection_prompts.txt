When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when there's multiple contributors or commiting from multiple devices


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?

Because you may not want to include the commit yet, might mess up your current build
